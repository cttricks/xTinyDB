# xTinyDB
The xTinyDB service communicates with a Web service to store and retrieve information. Although this service as an extension is usable, it is very limited and meant primarily as a demonstration for people who would like to create their own cloud database that talks to the Web. In this we have methods to store a value under a tag, retrieve the value associated with the tag and delete/clear tags and values from the server. The interpretation of what “store” and “retrieve” means is up to the Web service.

xTinyDB service is available mainly for MIT Appinventor and its distributions like Niotron & Kodular. This micro document database is inspired from the TinyWebDB component of MIT Appinventor. I have made many changes there to CRUD data easily with more features.

## What's new?
- Multiple values associated with the tags can be stored/updated in a bucket..
- Can call the entire bucket which returns a list of Tags, Values of those tags and Sub Buckets.
- One or more required tags can be called from a particular bucket at a time.
- One or more tags can be removed/cleared from the bucket.
- Entire bucket can be remove/cleared from the server

Note, I made this just for experiment. It is not a complete database solution. But yeah! Anyone can use this in your mini non-commercial project or say test projects. Also it can be used to create cache data for your app that you can use to improve user experience as this micro document database service can read/write data quickly and easily.
