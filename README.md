# xTinyDB
The xTinyDB service communicates with a Web service to store and retrieve information. Although this component is usable, it is very limited and meant primarily as a demonstration for people who would like to create their own components that talk to the Web. The component has methods to store a value under a tag and to retrieve the value associated with the tag. The interpretation of what “store” and “retrieve” means is up to the Web service.

xTinyDB service is available mainly for MIT Appinventor and it's distributions like Niotron, Kodular etc..
